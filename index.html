      <p>Data Analyst with a background troubleshooting technology and software as a Technology Assistant as well as experience with GIS data applications in the water industry. My strengths include problem solving, the ability to research, and a desire to expand my knowledge within technology, programming languages, and new ways to work with data.  
        I earned a certificate of Data Analytics through the University of California where I expanded my knowledge in skills like Python, SQL, NoSQL, Javascript, HTML, Excel, VBA, R, and Tableau. I have successfully created multiple data projects with teams of 4+ people that consisted of various Python and Javascript libraries in order to get raw data ready for presentation. 
        Transforming existing data from multiple sources to tell a new story with RESTful APIs, web scraping techniques, and flask applications is what excites me when working with data.
